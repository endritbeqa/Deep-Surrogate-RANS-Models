# Deep surrogate models for RANS simulation

Currently, there are 3 experiments being pursued:
1. [Steady State Flow Prediction](https://github.com/endritbeqa/Deep-Surrogate-RANS-Models/tree/Steady-State-Flow-Prediction)
2. [Uncertainty Aware Flow Prediction](https://github.com/endritbeqa/Deep-Surrogate-RANS-Models/tree/Uncertainty-Aware-Flow-Prediction)
3. [Turbulent Flow Prediction](https://github.com/endritbeqa/Deep-Surrogate-RANS-Models/tree/Turbulent-Flow-Prediction)
