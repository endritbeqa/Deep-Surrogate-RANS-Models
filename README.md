<h1> Deep surrogate models for RANS simulation</h1>

Currently, there are 3 experiments being pursued, using a Swin V2 U-net architecture. Experiments are:

1. [Steady State Flow Prediction](https://github.com/endritbeqa/Thesis/tree/Time-Averaged-Flow-Prediction)
2. [Uncertainty-aware Surrogate Models for Airfoil Flow Simulations](https://github.com/endritbeqa/Thesis/tree/Uncertainty-Aware-Transformer)
3. [Turbulent Flow Simulations](https://github.com/endritbeqa/Thesis/tree/sequence-modelling)
